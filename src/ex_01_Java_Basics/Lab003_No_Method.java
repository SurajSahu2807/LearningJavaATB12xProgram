    if here no main method is present in the program then we cannot run it.
    Because to run the program JVM searches for the main method signature i.e, public static void main(String[]
    args).

    > You can have multiple main functions, but only one function of main which is recognized by JVM should be present. The concept of multiple main function in the program is called as main method overloading.
